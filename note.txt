        Node.js RESTful API

Understanding RESTful APIs

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications that has become the standard for web services.

RESTful APIs provide a flexible, lightweight way to integrate applications and enable communication between different systems.
 Core Concepts:
- Resources: Everything is a resource (user, product, order)
- Representations: Resources can have multiple representations (JSON, XML, etc.)
- Stateless: Each request contains all necessary information
- Uniform Interface: Consistent way to access and manipulate resources

RESTful APIs use HTTP requests to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on resources, which are represented as URLs.

REST is stateless, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request.

** Unlike SOAP or RPC or RPC, REST is not a protocol but an architectural style that leverages existing web standards like HTTP, URL JSON, and XML.

Core REST Principles

Understanding these principles is curcial for designing effective RESTful APIs.
THey ensure your APII is scalable, maintainable, and easy to use.

KEY PRINCIPLES IN PRACTICE
- Resourse-Based: Focus on resources rather than actions
- Stateless: Each request is independent and self-contained
- Cacheable: Responses define their cacheability
- Uniform Interface: Consistent resource identification and manipulation
- Layered System: Client doesn;t need to know about the underlying architecture

The core principles of REST architecture include:
1. Client-Server Architecture: Separation of concerns between the client and the server
2. Statelessness: No client context is stored on the serveer between requests
3. Cacheability: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable
4. Layered System: A client cannot tell whether it is connected directly to the end server
5. Uniform Interface: Resources are identified in requests, resources are manipulated through representations, self-descriptive messages, and HATEOAS (Hypertext As The Engine Of Application State)

            HTTP Methods and Their Usage
RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform operations on resources.

Each method has specific semantics and should be used appropriately.

Idempotency and Safety:

- Safe Methods: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS (should not modify resources)
- Idempotent Methods: GET, PUT, DELETE (multiple identical requests = same effect as one)
- Non-Idempotent: POST, PATCH (may have different effects with multiple calls)

Always use the most specific method that matches your operation's intent.


Method	        Action	                        Example
GET	        Retrieve resource(s)        	GET /api/users
POST        	Create a new resource       	POST /api/users
PUT         	Update a resource completely	PUT /api/users/123
PATCH       	Update a resource partially     PATCH /api/users/123
DELETE      	Delete a resource	        DELETE /api/users/123

                RESTful API Structure and Design
A well-designed API follows consistent patterns that make it intuitive and easy to use. Good API design is crucial for developer experience and long-term maintainability.

Design Considerations:
- Resource Naming: Use nouns, not verbs (e.g., /users not /getUsers)
- Pluralization: Use plural for collections (/users/123 not /user/123)
- Hierarchy: Nest resources to show relationships (/users/123/orders)
- Filtering/Sorting: Use query parameters for optional operations
- Versioning Strategy: Plan for API versioning from the start (e.g., /v1/users vs /v2/users).

A well-structured API follows these conventions:

- Use nouns for resources: /users, /products, /orders (not /getUsers)
- Use plurals for collections: /users instead of /user
- Nest resources for relationships: /users/123/orders
- Use query parameters for filtering: /products?category=electronics&min_price=100
- Keep URLs consistent: Choose a convention (kebab-case, camelCase) and stick to it

        Example: Well-structured API Routes
// Good API structure
app.get('/api/products', getProducts);
app.get('/api/products/:id', getProductById);
app.get('/api/products/:id/reviews', getProductReviews);
app.get('/api/users/:userId/orders', getUserOrders);
app.post('/api/orders', createOrder);

// Filtering and pagination
app.get('/api/products?category=electronics&sort=price&limit=10&page=2');

                Building REST APIs with Node.js and Express
Node.js with Express.js provides an excellent foundation for building RESTful APIs.

The following sections outline best practices and patterns for implementation.

Key Components:

- Express Router: For organizing routes
- Middleware: For cross-cutting concerns
- Controllers: For handling request logic
- Models: For data access and business logic
- Services: For complex business logic
- Express.js is the most popular framework for building REST APIs in Node.js.

***Basic project structure**

Project Structure
- app.js # Main application file
- routes/ # Route definitions
  - users.js
  - products.js
- controllers/ # Request handlers
  - userController.js
  - productController.js
- models/ # Data models
  - User.js
  - Product.js
- middleware/ # Custom middleware
  - auth.js
  - validation.js
- config/ # Configuration files
  - db.js
  - env.js
- utils/ # Utility functions
  - errorHandler.js

        API Versioning
Versioning helps you evolve your API without breaking existing clients.

Common approaches include:

- URI Path Versioning: /api/v1/users
- Query Parameter: /api/users?version=1
- Custom Header: X-API-Version: 1
- Accept Header: Accept: application/vnd.myapi.v1+json

__________________________________________________________________________

      Request Validation
Always validate incoming requests to ensure data integrity and security.

Libraries like Joi or express-validator can help.

__________________________________________________________________________

      Error Handling
Implement consistent error handling to provide clear feedback to API consumers.

__________________________________________________________________________
        API Documentation
Good documentation is essential for API adoption.

Tools like Swagger/OpenAPI can automatically generate documentation from code

__________________________________________________________________________

      Testing APIs
Testing is critical for API reliability.

Use libraries like Jest, Mocha, or Supertest.

- Structure your API logically with resource-based URLs
- Return appropriate status codes in responses
- Implement proper error handling with clear messages
- Use pagination for large data sets
- Version your API to maintain backward compatibility
- Validate all input to prevent security issues
